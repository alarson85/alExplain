					<p>Hello world! Famous words to introduce you to myself through my work. This website reflects my personal taste, which tries to balance simplicity with all of the awesome things code can do. Personally, I love mixing old and new, you will find that I'm fairly eclectic that way, but you can learn more about me in, you guessed it, the <a>about</a> section</p>
				</div>
				<p>My <a>portfolio<a/> will highlight my upcoming projects and give you a veiw of my broader work.</p>
				<p>In my <a>blog</a>, I'll explain some of the concepts I've had a hard time with in JavaScript and some of the other languages I use.</p>
				<p>The <a>travel</a> section will always be a work in progress. I've always got a trip planned. Last I counted I was getting close to visiting 50 countries. Of course, I will start with my stomping grounds. That's right, an insiders guide to Salt Lake City.</p>

				<h3>Me</h3>
				<p>Thanks for stoping by! My name is Alex Larson. If you forget it's in the top corner. I was born in Bountiful, Utah and lived there a good portion of my life. I've also lived in southern California, and Spain. I graduated from the University of Utah with a degree in Spanish. I've worn many hats in my life from teaching to social work. I have a passion for making life better which has led me to my current situation, looking for a career in Web Development. I believe that technology has the ability to transform the way we live for the better, and I want to be a part of it.</p>
				<p>I have a lot of interests in addition to coding. I'm an avid traveler, love hiking and camping, workout frequently, and spend as much times with friends and family as possible.</p>
				<h3>This website</h3>
				<p>This website was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I'd like to give a special thanks to my barista for providing me the caffine required to figure out how to make the background change colors.</p>
				<h3>Contact Info</h3>
				<p>Have questions? Feel free to email me.

				<p>Learning to code is complicated, but if you break it down enough, I believe that it is simple to understand. <a href="http://www.alexplain.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">I'll explain.</a> (opens in new page)</p>
